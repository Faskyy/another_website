    <p>
        This lab is an introductory lab to HTML & CSS. For this lab, I was tasked with
        the creation of this lovely, simple website! This wasn't much of an issue for
        me as I am fairly familiar with HTML and CSS, having some experience in it
        not only through internships but project experiences as well.<br /><br />

        I used a lot of CSS styling for this lab. To be specific, I made a styling sheet
        for every HTML page. I think the most complex styling I used was for the
        navigation bar, since I made my elements highlight everytime I hovered over them. <br /><br />

        I also used float elements for both my Index and my About so I can wrap the text around my pictures.<br /><br />
        I didn't think this assignment was too hard, but ideally I think that more time would've been preferred due to
        the amount of work I had to do for other classes as well. I also think that more time was necessary due to the issues
        I experienced with publishing and mapping my network. Overall, coding the website was not a problem.
